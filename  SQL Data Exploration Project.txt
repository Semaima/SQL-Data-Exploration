TITLE: DATA EXPLORATION

This data consists of two Table; CovidDeath as 'Table1' and CovidVaccination as 'Table2'


******Select all Data in Table1
SELECT   *
FROM     `data-analytics-project-387607.Portfolio_Project.CovidDeaths`
ORDER BY  3,4


****Select the data that I am going to be using
SELECT    location, date, total_cases, total_deaths, population
FROM     `data-analytics-project-387607.Portfolio_Project.CovidDeaths`
ORDER BY  1,2


*****Looking at total_cases vs total_deaths
******shows likelihood of dying if you contract covid in your country
SELECT    location, date, total_cases, total_deaths, (total_deaths/total_cases)*100 as DeathPercentage
FROM     `data-analytics-project-387607.Portfolio_Project.CovidDeaths`
WHERE     location like '%States%'
ORDER BY  1,2


****Looking at total_cases vs Population
****shows what Percentage of population got Covid
SELECT    location, date, total_cases, population, (total_deaths/population)*100 as CovidPercentage
FROM     `data-analytics-project-387607.Portfolio_Project.CovidDeaths`
WHERE     location like '%States%'
ORDER BY  1,2


****Looking at the country with the highest infection rate compared to population
SELECT    location,  population, MAX(total_cases) as HighestInfectionCount, MAX(total_cases/population)*100 as PercentPopulationInfected
FROM     `data-analytics-project-387607.Portfolio_Project.CovidDeaths`
GROUP BY  location, population
ORDER BY  PercentPopulationInfected desc


****Showing countries with the higest death count per population
SELECT    location, MAX(cast(total_deaths as int))  as TotaldeathCount
FROM     `data-analytics-project-387607.Portfolio_Project.CovidDeaths`
GROUP BY  location
ORDER BY  TotalDeathCount desc


**** BBREAKING THINGS DOWN BY CONTINENT
****Showing continent with the higest death count per population
SELECT    continent, MAX(cast(total_deaths as int))  as TotaldeathCount
FROM     `data-analytics-project-387607.Portfolio_Project.CovidDeaths`
WHERE     continent is not null
GROUP BY  continent
ORDER BY  TotalDeathCount desc


****GLOBAL NUMBERS
SELECT    SUM(new_cases) as total_cases, SUM(cast(new_deaths as int)) as total_deaths, SUM(cast(new_deaths as int))/SUM(new_cases)*100 as DeathPercentage
FROM     `data-analytics-project-387607.Portfolio_Project.CovidDeaths`
WHERE     continent is not null
ORDER BY  1,2


****Looking at total population vs vaccination
****Here we join Table1 and Table2

SELECT    dea.continent, dea.location, dea.date, dea.population, vac.new_vaccinations,SUM(CONVERT(int, vac.new_vaccinations)) OVER (PARTITION BY dea.location ORDER BY dea.location, dea.date) as RollingPeopleVaccinated
FROM     `data-analytics-project-387607.Portfolio_Project.CovidDeaths` dea
JOIN     `data-analytics-project-387607.Portfolio_Project.CovidVaccination` vac
    ON    dea.location= vac.location
    AND   dea.date= vac.date
WHERE     dea.continent is not null
ORDER BY  2,3


**** Use CTE

WITH PopvsVac (continent, location, date, new_vaccinations,RollingPeopleVaccination) as

SELECT    dea.continent, dea.location, dea.date, dea.population, vac.new_vaccinations,SUM(CONVERT(int, vac.new_vaccinations)) OVER (PARTITION BY dea.location ORDER BY dea.location, dea.date) as RollingPeopleVaccinated

SELECT*, (RollingPeoplevaccinated/population)*100

****TEMP TABLE

DROP TABLE if exist #PercentPopulationVaccinated
CREATE TABLE #PercentPopulationVaccinated
